# Network flows

Every connection Boite opens beyond the machine it runs on, when it fires, what
it sends, how a user turns it off and the [admin policy](enterprise.md) key that
blocks it. Inventory taken from `origin/main` at `1654f1b0` (2026-10-28) over
the core, the UI, the desktop shell, the CLI and plugins.

Not listed: what an agent CLI sends to its model provider during a turn (choose
the agents with `providers.allow` or `providers.deny`), build and CI scripts,
the Android apps, and loopback-only traffic (local gateways, the speech server,
the OpenCode server, protected bridges, health checks).

## Flows with no user switch

Each one is either blocked by a policy key or started by the user:

- Rows 4 and 6, the app and server update checks: `updates.app`, `updates.server`.
- Row 8, agent version checks: `updates.agents`.
- Row 21, recommended plugin checks, including on opening Settings > Plugins: `plugins.recommended`.
- Row 30, pull request discovery and watch: `pullRequests`.
- Row 32, the agent browser: `agentBrowser`.
- Row 45, the agent-desktop download: `agentDesktop`.
- Row 33, remote resources in previews: `previews.remoteResources`.
- Rows 5, 7, 20, 22, 23, 26, 27 and 29, downloads, installs, credential moves
  and reports the user clicks: blocked by `updates.app`, `updates.server`,
  `gateway`, `plugins.install`, `dictation` and `issueReports`.
- Rows 12 and 43, agent installs and sign-ins: blocked for a provider outside
  `providers.allow` or in `providers.deny`; for an allowed provider they run
  only on the user's click, since choosing the agent is the administrator's
  decision and installing it is the user's.
- Rows 31, 37 and 44: user-initiated toward a destination the user chose, as
  the table says.
