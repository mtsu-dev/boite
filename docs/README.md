- [Groups](groups.md): one owner's machines and devices, invitations, addresses and trust.
- [Contacts](contacts.md): experimental collaboration with another owner on explicitly shared projects.

- [Agent brain](brain.md): shared instructions, skill discovery and Git synchronization.
- [Agent hooks](hooks.md): hooks on each account and what they blocked.
- [Plugins](plugins.md): install recommended plugins or a Git URL, and write your own.
