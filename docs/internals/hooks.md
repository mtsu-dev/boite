# Agent hooks

A hook is a command or a plugin an agent runs around its own events: before a
tool call, when a prompt is submitted, when a turn ends. Hooks belong to the
agent. Boite never runs one itself; it makes sure the agent finds the user's
hooks on every account, and says what they did. The code is
`packages/core/src/hooks.ts` for the ledger, `profile-share.ts` for isolated
accounts, and the Claude and Codex drivers for the reports.

## Where each agent keeps them

| Agent | Hooks | Format | Per-run report |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | `hooks` in `settings.json` under `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, plus plugin hooks | events | yes |
| Codex | `hooks.json` under `CODEX_HOME`, each hook trusted in `config.toml` | events | yes |
| Grok | `hooks/*.json` under `GROK_HOME`, and Claude's `~/.claude/settings.json` | events | no |
| pi | extensions under `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/extensions` | modules | no |
| OpenCode | plugins under `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/plugins` | modules | no |
| OpenCode 2 | `~/.config/opencode-v2/opencode/plugins`, with the version 2 plugin API | modules | no |

The descriptor's `hookSources` names these places
([providers.md](providers.md#hooks-and-shared-configuration)), and Settings reads
them to count what is configured. An `events` source is a JSON file, or a
directory of them, shaped `{ "hooks": { "<Event>": [{ "matcher": "...",
"hooks": [...] }] } }`; each inner entry counts as one hook. A `modules` source
is a directory of scripts, where each `.js`, `.ts`, `.mjs` or `.cjs` file and
each package directory counts as one.

When a profile sets an XDG home itself, source counting and isolated-account
sharing use that home. OpenCode 2 therefore never loads version 1's plugins
from an inherited `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

## Isolated accounts

The descriptor's `shared` paths bring user configuration into isolated accounts
before spawn: linked directories, copied files and no login/session files.
[Accounts](accounts.md#what-an-isolated-account-shares) owns that layout and its
failure rules. Codex's copied `config.toml` retargets reviewed `hooks.json`
paths to the isolated directory. New hook trust must be reviewed in the user's
own Codex profile; a later spawn copies it.

A conversation started in a [context mode](context-modes.md) carries
`BOITE_CONTEXT=<label>` in its environment, and `BOITE_GUIDES=0` when it drops
guides. A hook that adds context at session start or on each prompt can check
the second and print nothing; `neutral` runs none of the user's hooks.

## What Boite reports

Claude runs with the SDK's `includeHookEvents`, which sends a `hook_response`
message after each hook. Exit code 2 reads as `blocked`; any other failure or
a cancellation reads as `failed`. A hook that exits 0 can still
decide: `continue: false` reads as `stopped`, and `decision: "block"` or a
`permissionDecision` of `deny` read as `blocked`. The reason comes from that
decision, else from stderr.

Codex sends `hook/completed` with the run's status (`completed`, `failed`,
`blocked`, `stopped`) and the hook's own feedback lines. When its process starts,
Boite also asks `hooks/list`: an enabled hook Codex skips because nobody
reviewed it, or because it changed since, counts as `skipped`, once per account
and event.

Grok, pi and OpenCode run their hooks, but their protocols say nothing about a
run. Settings shows their sources and whether each isolated account has them,
and says there is no report.

## Where it shows

A hook that refuses the prompt or stops the turn appears in the thread with
its event and reason. Other runs contribute to the Settings ledger.

Everything else goes to Settings > Agents > Scripts your agents run, a card that shows with or
without a brain folder. Each agent that runs hooks has one row: what it found
("13 hooks", "2 modules") and, for Claude and Codex, the counts since the core
started (runs, blocked, failed, skipped). Opening the row lists each source
path. A source Boite cannot read, or a path an isolated account did not get,
shows under the row without opening it. Below the rows, the most recent runs
that did not pass, newest first, each with its agent, event, hook and reason:
five open, the rest of the last 50 folded.

`hooks.status` returns that view and `hooks.changed` tells the clients a run was
recorded. Reading it lays out each isolated account's share again, the way a
spawn does, so the problems it lists are the ones the next turn would meet. Both are
owner-only: a hook's reason can quote a path or a command.
The ledger lives in memory and starts again with the core; a run that passed
only adds to its count.

## The models probe

The Claude model probe sets `settings.disableAllHooks`, so discovery does not
fire `SessionStart`. [Providers](providers.md#the-models-probe) owns the other
protocol-specific probe restrictions. YOLO keeps hooks: it skips approvals, not
the user's hooks. They are off only in a [context mode](context-modes.md)
without hooks, in protected execution (Claude and Codex remove native tools
there, and a hook must not bring them back) and in Boite's internal runs (model
and quota probes, Codex title generation).

## Limits

- Shared settings are copied whole. Embedded API configuration applies to the
  isolated account too; see [account sharing](accounts.md#what-an-isolated-account-shares).
- Grok, pi and OpenCode can run hooks but supply no per-run events to Boite.
- A hook blocking a tool call does not end the turn, so it shows in Settings
  only; the agent's own reply usually says it was refused.
- A test core (`BOITE_HOST_AGENTS=0`) never shares or reads the developer's own
  profile: sources show their path with no count.

## Verification

- `bun test packages/core/test/profile-share.test.ts`: links, copies, the three
  spellings of a retargeted path, an account's own file set aside once, removal
  when the source goes, and removal of an account leaving the source alone.
- `bun test packages/core/test/hooks.test.ts`: descriptor refusals, source
  counting and the ledger (dedupe of skips, the 50-run cap, the 500-character
  reason).
- `bun test packages/core/test/claude.hooks.test.ts` and `-t "codex hooks"` in
  `codex.test.ts`: a blocked prompt draws the line in the thread and counts in
  `hooks.status`, on a fake SDK and a fake app-server.

These use fake SDK/app-server fixtures. Native hook-report compatibility still
depends on the installed CLI and SDK versions; fixture coverage does not prove
every later version's behavior.
