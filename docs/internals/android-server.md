# Boite on an Android phone

This is the server, separate from the [Android client app](android.md).
Installing the client alone does not install Termux, a core or agent CLIs.

`apps/android-server` turns a phone into a Boite machine: the core and the
agents run on it, and the person's other devices open it like any
[headless server](server.md). It has two parts:

- `termux/`: `install.sh` and the `boite-server` command, which run in
  [Termux](https://termux.dev), the Linux environment for Android.
- `app/`: the Boite Server app (`com.boite.server`), a native screen that
  drives `boite-server` through Termux. It installs nothing itself and holds no
  data.

The app's version is its own (`apps/android-server/VERSION`), apart from
Boite's: the core it runs updates itself.

## What a phone needs

- A 64-bit ARM processor (`aarch64`). `install.sh` refuses any other.
- Android 7 (API 24) or later, the app's `minSdk`.
- Termux from F-Droid or from its GitHub releases. The Google Play build is a
  separate, experimental one that Boite Server is not tested with.
- Several hundred megabytes for the first install: Termux packages, Bun,
  the release and Claude Code.

## Installing

The app opens on the step the phone is at: install Termux, allow the app to
run commands in it (the `com.termux.permission.RUN_COMMAND` permission, asked
once), then run the install command it shows, for the stable or nightly
channel:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mtsu-dev/boite/main/apps/android-server/termux/install.sh | bash -s -- --channel stable
```

`install.sh`:

1. Upgrades Termux (it supports no partial upgrade) and installs `git`,
   `ripgrep`, `curl`, `unzip` and `glibc-runner`, then `codex` where the
   repository has it.
2. Downloads Bun's Android build, `bun-linux-aarch64-android.zip`, at the
   version pinned in the script, and refuses it unless its SHA-256 matches.
3. Writes the `boite-server` command on Termux's `PATH` and sets
   `allow-external-apps = true` in `~/.termux/termux.properties`, without
   which Termux refuses the app's commands.
4. Runs `boite-server install`: the signed release, Claude Code, then the
   core.

Running it again updates everything and keeps the conversations. `--bundle
<zip>` installs a local `boite-server_<version>_android.zip` instead of
downloading one.

Everything lives in `~/.boite-server`: `config.json`, the supervisor's
`server.json`, `core.log` (moved to `core.log.1` past 8 MB), `releases/` with
`current` pointing at one (the previous one is kept), `runtime/` for Bun,
`agents/`, `cli/` and `data/`, the core's `BOITE_DATA_DIR`.

## The `boite-server` command

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `install [--channel stable\|nightly] [--bundle <zip>] [--no-claude]` | First install, also run by `install.sh`. |
| `start`, `stop`, `restart` | `stop` asks the core to end and kills it after 60 s. |
| `status [--quick]` | `--quick` leaves out the agents' versions, which take seconds to read. |
| `pair [--owner]` | A one-time link for a phone or browser, or with `--owner` for a desktop app. |
| `update [--check] [--force] [--bundle <zip>]` | The newest release of the channel. |
| `agents` | Installs or updates Claude Code. |
| `sign-in claude\|codex` | Runs the agent's own sign-in in this terminal, then has the core read the accounts again. |
| `config [<key> <value>]` | `channel stable\|nightly`, `host lan\|tailscale\|local`, `port <n>`, `autostart on\|off`, `name <text>`. |
| `logs [<lines>]` | The end of `core.log`. |
| `uninstall [--purge]` | `--purge` also deletes `data/`. |

Each takes `--json`, which is what the app reads: one JSON line on stdout,
with `ok` and, when false, `error`.

`host` decides where the core listens: `lan` on every interface, so the
Wi-Fi and Tailscale addresses both answer; `tailscale` on the tailnet address
alone, waiting until the phone joins it; `local` on this phone only. A change
to `host` or `port` applies on the next start.

While the Tailscale app is connected, the core finds the tailnet address on
the `tun` interface the app opens. Unless `host` is `local`, the group's roster
then gives the phone's MagicDNS name and tailnet address before the Wi-Fi one,
so the other machines still reach the phone away from that Wi-Fi.

`name` is what the other machines of a group and every client call the phone.
Android gives every app the host name `localhost`, and the name set in the
phone's own settings is out of Termux's reach, so without one the core goes by
the maker and model from `getprop` (`OnePlus GM1913`). `boite-server` passes it
to the core as `BOITE_MACHINE_NAME`; `config name ""` returns to the maker and
model. A change applies on the next start, and the group's roster then carries
it to the other machines.

## Releases and updates

`desktop.yml` builds `boite-server_<version>_android.zip` on its Linux x64 job
(`scripts/ci/android-server-bundle.ts`, `androidServerBundle` in
`packages/core/bin/server-bundle.ts`): the core's scripts, the UI,
`boite-server.ts` and `server-release.json`, which names the Bun build the
release runs on.
`updater-manifest.ts` lists it in the release's `latest.json` under the
`android-aarch64-server` target, signed with the key the desktop updater
trusts.

`update` picks the newest GitHub release of its channel whose `latest.json`
carries that target, checks the Minisign signature against the same public
key and unpacks it beside the running release, which keeps serving meanwhile.
Before it stops the core it reads what `current`, `bin/bun` and the controller
point at and writes the `boite` command. It then stops the core, moves the
release into place, switches the three and starts it again. When a step fails
or the new core never answers, every one goes back to its exact previous
target, the replaced copy of a reinstalled version included, and the previous
core starts again. A core counts as answering only when `/health` reports the
PID the supervisor launched and the version of the release it runs: another
Boite on the same port is not mistaken for it, in `start`, `status` or an
update. Until a stable release carries
the target, the stable channel answers that none does and names the nightly
one.

Desktop and phone clients use `core.updateStatus`, `core.updateInstall` and
`core.updateCancel` for this managed installation too (`mode: android`). The
channel comes from the Android server's `config.json`, including when it
differs from the running core's version. `boite server update` uses the same
path. The machine policy's `updates.server` setting controls checks and installs.

The core starts the controller through its traced process registry. The
controller detaches a worker with a private copy of itself and its signed
`managed-update.ts` companion, so stopping the core and its supervisor leaves
the update running. It downloads, verifies and unpacks the exact offered
version before signalling readiness. The core can cancel before admission;
agent updates hold admission, and active turns use the normal restart handoff.
Only admission lets the worker stop the server and activate the prepared
release, using the same rollback and health checks as the Termux command.
An offer or channel that changed since the check is refused.

New supervisors export `BOITE_ANDROID_SERVER_ROOT`. Existing supervisors are
also detected from their matching data, CLI and release UI paths. The core can
run the controller and companion from the signed current release when an older
updater copied only the root controller. If neither installed controller
supports managed update protocol 1, the status reports an explicit error:
run `boite-server update` once in Termux to install a release that supports it.
It does not offer an update the installed controller cannot perform. A worker
result is read again on status calls, so a rollback failure written after the
restored core started remains visible after reconnecting.

## Running and starting with the phone

`start` launches a supervisor detached from Termux, which takes Termux's wake
lock (CPU and Wi-Fi stay up with the screen off) and starts the core again
when it exits, waiting 1 s, then 2, 5, 10, 30 and 60 s while it keeps exiting
within a minute.

The app's `BootReceiver` answers `BOOT_COMPLETED` and the `QUICKBOOT_POWERON`
broadcasts some makers send instead. It runs `boite-server boot`, which starts
the core when `autostart` is on and a release is installed. It does not wait
for the network: with `host` set to `tailscale`, the core listens once the
phone joins the tailnet.

Many makers stop that broadcast or the processes it starts. The app's "Keep it
running" section asks for:

- Termux's battery use set to Unrestricted.
- Boite Server allowed to start with the phone, where the phone has a switch
  for it. OxygenOS 12 has it in the app's settings, Battery usage, Allow auto
  launch; without it the app receives no `BOOT_COMPLETED`.
- On Android 12 and later, Developer options › Disable child process
  restrictions where the phone offers it: Android 12's phantom process killer
  otherwise stops background child processes past 32 across all apps.
- The [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com) guide for the phone's
  maker.

## Agents in Termux

Claude Code's Linux build expects glibc, which Android lacks. `boite-server`
installs it under `agents/` and runs it through the loader `glibc-runner`
provides. Termux's `termux-exec` preload would break that loader, so the
`claude` wrapper moves `LD_PRELOAD` to `BOITE_TERMUX_PRELOAD` and Claude's
commands run through `~/.boite-server/shell/bash` (its `SHELL` and
`CLAUDE_CODE_SHELL`), which puts the preload back: `#!/usr/bin/env` scripts
then work in its commands. Claude's own updater is off (`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`);
the app's "Update Claude Code" runs `boite-server agents`.

Codex comes from Termux's package, updated with `pkg upgrade codex`.

The core sees `process.platform === 'android'` under Bun's Android build and
treats it as Linux through `currentOs()`.

## Signing an agent in

A conversation gets no answer until its agent is signed in. `status` reports
`signIns`, each agent's best account status from `boite-core accounts --json`
(`ok`, `unknown`, `error` or `unauthenticated`); `status --quick` leaves it
out. The app's "Agents" section shows it while the core runs.

Its "Sign in" button runs `boite-server sign-in <agent>` in a new Termux
terminal, which Termux brings forward: `claude auth login` through the
`claude` wrapper, or `codex login --device-auth`. Each prints a link to open
and, for Claude, asks for the code the page gives back. The command then runs
`boite-core accounts --refresh`: the core reloads its providers, which adopts
the CLI's login as a default account, and checks every account. Coming back to
the app reads the status again.

A paired desktop app can sign the phone's agents in from its Settings ›
Providers instead.

## Pairing

`pair` asks the running core for a one-time link. The core may build it on a
mobile data address, so `boite-server` rewrites it onto the addresses
`status` lists (Wi-Fi, then Tailscale) and returns them all as `urls`. The app
draws the chosen one as a QR code under `FLAG_SECURE`, which keeps it out of
screenshots and the recent apps view, and copies it marked sensitive. The
logs the app shows replace any `grant` or `token` value with `…`.

## The app

`app/` is Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, colors from Boite's dark palette
(`Theme.kt`), strings in `res/values/strings.xml` with the French in
`res/values-fr/`. `Termux.kt` sends `com.termux.RUN_COMMAND` with a
`PendingIntent` that brings the command's stdout, stderr and exit code back;
`Model.kt` polls `status --quick` every 5 s while the screen is visible.

Building it needs JDK 17 and the Android SDK (platform 37):

```sh
cd apps/android-server
./gradlew assembleDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease -PboiteVersion=1.0.3 -PboiteVersionCode=1000003
```

Without the properties, the version is `VERSION` with patch 0. A release APK
comes out unsigned; `apksigner` signs it.

`bun test ./apps/android-server` runs the controller's tests and
`bun run check:android-server` type-checks it.

## Publishing the app

`ci.yml` builds the APK unsigned, the `Android server / apk` check, when
`apps/android-server` outside `termux/`, `android-server.yml`,
`scripts/ci/android-server-apk.ts` or `scripts/ci/android-apk.ts` change.
`termux/` is not in the APK but in the release bundle, so a change there runs
the core suite, which packs it, the type checks and the desktop jobs, which
build it.

The nightly runs `android-server.yml` with `release` on, and the release
attaches `boite-server-android-<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>.apk` beside the Boite app's
APK and lists it in `SHA256SUMS.txt`. `android-server-apk.ts reuse` takes back
the newest published one when its tag is in the checkout, nothing under
`apps/android-server` outside `termux/` changed since that tag, and its
certificate is still the one `assetlinks.json` publishes. Otherwise the job
builds the next patch and signs it with the Boite app's key (`ANDROID_KEYSTORE`,
alias `boite`), then checks that certificate the same way: Android refuses an
update signed with another key.

The version counts like the Boite app's ([Android](android.md#the-app-version)):
`VERSION` holds MAJOR.MINOR, raised by hand and never below the published one,
and the patch grows only when the APK is rebuilt.
