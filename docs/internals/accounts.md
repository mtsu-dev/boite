# Accounts

An account combines a provider descriptor and a login directory. Isolated
accounts keep separate configuration and credentials. `packages/core/src/accounts.ts`
owns their lifecycle; [providers](providers.md) defines descriptor fields.

`accounts.logins` restores running login cards after reconnect. `accounts.loginCancel`
stops the login process and waits for it to exit. Removing an account does the
same before deleting its isolated directory; default CLI directories stay on
disk. Removal also stops connection checks and model discovery before deleting
the directory, and blocks new account operations while it runs. Removal is
refused while a turn is queued or running on the account.

## The isolation directory

Every account Boite creates gets `<dataDir>/accounts/<id>/`, and the descriptor's
`isolation` map decides what that directory means to the agent. The map is
environment variables, with `{isolationDir}` substituted at spawn:

- OpenCode moves with the XDG pair, `XDG_DATA_HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and
  files its login at `opencode/auth.json` under the data one.
- Codex moves with `CODEX_HOME`, and files `auth.json` directly under it.
- pi moves with `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, which is the whole config directory, so
  one variable is enough and the session file is `auth.json` under it.
- Claude moves with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and files `.credentials.json`.
- Grok moves with `GROK_HOME`, and files `auth.json`.
- Muse Code moves with the three XDG homes, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`
  and `XDG_STATE_HOME`, and files its login at `muse/auth.json` under the config
  one, which is `~/.config/muse/auth.json` for the default account.
- Antigravity moves with `GEMINI_HOME`, files `antigravity-acp/acp_token.json`
  under it, and has no default account at all: its descriptor says
  `isolation.alwaysIsolated`, so `accounts.add` gives every account a directory
  of its own whatever the request asked for. The agent reads its user skills
  under `GEMINI_HOME`, so the descriptor shares `config/skills` and
  `antigravity-cli/skills` from the user's own `~/.gemini`; its MCP servers and
  settings stay out. Project skills (`.gemini/skills`, `.agents/skills`, then
  the legacy `.agent/skills`) the agent reads itself in the thread's folder.

The same environment goes to every process of that account: a turn, a probe, a
login. The OS profile owns the map; drivers use the resolved account environment.

## What an isolated account shares

Isolation moves the whole configuration directory, so without more an isolated
account runs with none of the user's settings, hooks, skills or instructions.
The descriptor's `shared` block ([providers.md](providers.md#hooks-and-shared-configuration))
names what it takes from the user's own directory, and the core lays it out
before every spawn (`packages/core/src/profile-share.ts`):

- A directory is linked: a junction on Windows, a symlink elsewhere. The account
  sees the user's `skills` or `plugins` as they are now, and an edit through the
  link lands in the user's own directory.
- A file is copied, so an agent that rewrites its settings writes its own copy.
  The next spawn replaces a copy that differs from the source; the user's file
  wins over the agent's edit. A copy listed under `retarget` has the source's
  paths rewritten to the account's own.
- Something already there that Boite did not put there is set aside once as
  `<name>.own-<date>`, never deleted. A file or directory the user removed from
  their own directory goes from the account too, as long as it is still what
  Boite put there.
- A path with a link between it and the account directory is not shared, since
  whatever went through the link would land outside the account.
- A JSON file the agent keeps for itself shares only the keys its descriptor
  names under `sharedKeys`: Claude's `.claude.json` takes `mcpServers` from
  `~/.claude.json` and keeps its own sign-in identity and project state. Each
  key follows the copy rules above, the user's value winning, and the file is
  written only when a key changed.
- `.boite-shared.json` in the account directory records the links, the hash
  of each copy and of each shared key, which is how Boite tells its own work
  from the account's.

A path that fails is logged once and shown under the account in Settings >
Agents > Scripts your agents run; the spawn goes on without it. The login files never move: a
share that would cover one is refused when the descriptor loads. The default
account needs none of this, since it runs on the user's own directory. A test
core (`BOITE_HOST_AGENTS=0`) shares nothing.

| Provider | Shared configuration paths |
| --- | --- |
| Claude | `settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `skills`, `plugins`, `agents`, `commands`, `hooks`, `output-styles`; the `mcpServers` key of `.claude.json` |
| Codex | `config.toml`, `hooks.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `skills`, `rules`, `prompts`, `plugins` |
| Grok | `config.toml`, `hooks`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`, `skills`, `trusted_folders.toml`, `installed-plugins` |
| pi | `settings.json`, `AGENTS.md`, `extensions`, `skills`, `prompts`, `themes` |
| OpenCode | `opencode/opencode.json`, `opencode/opencode.jsonc`, `opencode/AGENTS.md`, `opencode/package.json`, plugin/agent/command/skill directories and `opencode/node_modules` |

These are whole-file copies or linked directories. An API setting or key inside
a shared settings file applies to every account using that file, as in the
user's CLI. Dedicated login/session files remain excluded. The shipped
descriptors are the authority for each provider's current path list;
[hooks](hooks.md) owns source discovery and reporting.

## The default account

An account whose `isolationDir` is null runs on the provider's own default
location, which is the user's real CLI login. Boite reads its existing authentication
without moving the configuration.

Startup, provider reloads and managed installs adopt that account when a CLI
login exists. If its session files are absent and Boite can run a piped login,
they leave account creation to guided sign-in, which creates one isolated
account named after the provider. No signed-out `Default` account is added
beside it. Terminal logins retain the default account, and a provider whose
login can live outside session files retains its account with unknown status.

Removing a default account opts that provider out of automatic adoption on this
core. Reloads, managed installs and core restarts respect that choice, even if
the CLI remains signed in or changes its login. The CLI's own files stay intact,
and other providers are unaffected. Guided sign-in can still create a new
isolated account. "Use my command-line login" explicitly restores the CLI
account and permits automatic adoption again, through an account added with
`useDefaultLocation: true`.

The core resolves unset isolation variables to provider defaults: the XDG pair resolve
under `~/.local/share` and `~/.config`,
`CODEX_HOME` to `~/.codex`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` to `~/.claude`, `GROK_HOME`
to `~/.grok`, and `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` to `.pi/agent` under the home.
A variable the core does not know falls back to `~/.<id>`. A new isolation variable must
add its default location to that table in the
same change, or passive checks can report a signed-in account as unauthenticated.

## What the core checks

`accounts.check` reads the files `auth.session` names. A passive check answers
`ok` when the files exist, `unauthenticated` when they are absent, `unknown`
when the provider can store its login elsewhere, or `error` when the check fails.
A provider that names `auth.sqlite` is read the same way from its database:
`ok` once a listed table holds a row
([providers.md](providers.md#opencode-2)).
Claude on macOS and Windows reads `unknown` without its file, because its CLI
can keep the login in the Keychain or in Credential Manager. A signed-out CLI
reads `unknown` there too. Startup reads every account stored as
`unauthenticated` again: one written under an older rule recovers when it now
reads otherwise, and one the agent itself refused stays signed out.

The Check connection button requests a fresh login check, without listing
models or sending a prompt. Codex reads its account through the app-server with
`refreshToken: true`; Claude asks its CLI for `auth status --json`, including
Keychain and Credential Manager accounts. Both return the signed-in email. Other providers retain their
session-file check. A failed check displays its reason instead of reporting a
model count. Passive checks do not launch an agent process.

A native Claude authentication refusal marks the account signed out, including
when it happens during preparation before the first prompt. Boite remembers
the refusal across restarts: a session file alone cannot restore the connected
status. A successful fresh CLI check or completed sign-in clears it. Billing,
rate limits and failures inside subagents do not invalidate the account.

An HTTP 403 does not either. The Claude CLI labels it `authentication_failed`
as it does a 401, so the driver holds that label until the turn's result: a
403 in its `api_error_status`, or in the frame's own text ("API Error: 403"),
fails only that turn, with the API's words after "Claude refused this request;
the account is still signed in." Any other status signs the account out, and
so does a CLI that exits before its result. A 401 result signs it out even
with no labelled frame before it. A new login cannot grant a
permission, and a signed-out account would refuse every later turn.

Changed account statuses and identities reach every client as `accounts.updated`.
An unchanged passive check writes no journal row and sends no event.
`accounts.rename` changes the label of any account, including a default CLI
account, while keeping its ID, login directory and thread references.

Settings shows the chosen account label and its email separately. Emails stay
blurred until hovered, focused from the keyboard or tapped on a phone.
The model picker's account chips and their tooltips show the chosen label only.

## The login flow

For an isolated account, the descriptor's `login` block is the argv of the
provider's own login command, and the core runs it rather than asking the user to
open a terminal:

1. `accounts.login` spawns it through `procs.spawnPiped` under the synthetic
   thread `login:<accountId>`, so it sits in a Job Object and in the trace like
   any agent process. It runs with the account's environment, the isolation
   directory as its working directory, and stdin open.
2. Its output comes back line by line as `account.login`, `state: "running"`. The
   first `https://` link it prints is carried separately in `url`, so the UI can
   offer it as something to click rather than as text to find.
3. A CLI that asks for a code takes it through `accounts.loginInput`, one line
   into the running process's stdin.
4. On exit the event carries `done` or `failed` with the exit code, the core
   rechecks the account, and `accounts.updated` follows.

Codex uses the app-server's `account/login/start` with `chatgptDeviceCode`.
The core carries its verification URL and code directly to the client, keeps
both visible until `account/login/completed`, then checks the resulting account.
The user enters the code on the sign-in page, with no code field to send it back
to Boite. Cancellation closes the process; expired codes show a retryable error.
Piped login output from other agents has terminal control sequences removed
before the core extracts links or displays text.

Failed sign-ins have a Close button. Cancelling stops an ongoing post-login
connection check as well as the login process; a refused login command reports
its failure immediately without starting that check. The account can then be
retried or removed from its row.

The other shape is `login.acp`, for an ACP agent whose sign-in is the protocol's
own `authenticate` call rather than a command. The core starts the agent itself
under the same `login:<accountId>` thread, sends `initialize` then `authenticate`
with the descriptor's method id, refuses a method the agent does not advertise,
and gives up after five minutes. Once signed in, the same process opens one
session in an empty folder to list the account's models, so no second launch
is needed to read them ([providers](providers.md#the-models-probe)). The sign-in link arrives as a line on the agent's
stdout that is not JSON, and Antigravity writes it to stderr too; either line
reaches the page whole, in `url` (a link cut to an error message's length asks
Google for a scope that ends mid-URL). The agent
holds a loopback listener for the redirect, so a browser on the core's machine
finishes the flow on its own; from a phone, the redirect URL pasted into
`accounts.loginInput` is fetched once by the core. What is accepted is narrow on
purpose: a loopback URL whose port and path are the ones the agent asked for in
the `redirect_uri` of the link it printed. A paste aimed anywhere else on the
machine is refused by name, and no redirect is followed. Antigravity is the
shipped example.

A login that insists on opening a browser window of its own is one Boite points at
a launcher that does nothing, through the profile's `BROWSER` variable, so the link
goes to the page and never to a window over the user's work.

## The guided connection

When the composer has no usable provider, its model chip becomes `Connect an AI` and
opens `ConnectFlow.svelte`:
Claude and Codex first, each naming the plan it uses, the other agents below.
Choosing one walks the same steps as its row in the Providers card
(`lib/provider-setup.ts`), one at a time: the download when Boite can fetch the
agent, its own installer page otherwise, then the sign-in with the page to open
and the field for a code. An agent whose login is a menu (see below) gets the
same terminal as in the Providers card, inside the dialog. A download asked for
here goes on to the sign-in by itself. Once the account answers, `Use <provider>` moves
the composer to it
through `store.useProvider`, the same remembered choice a pick in the model
picker writes, and the text being typed stays where it was.

Each step replaces the button that led to it, so the dialog moves the keyboard
to the new step's first control whenever focus has fallen out of it: a
keyboard user goes from `Install` to `Cancel`, to the sign-in link, then to
`Use <provider>` without reaching for the mouse. On a phone the dialog is a
sheet at the bottom of the screen, and its last button stays above the home
indicator. The dialog renders beside the app root, so the link listener that
hands `http(s)` links to the shell's system browser sits on the document body:
on the root alone, the dialog's sign-in link did nothing in the desktop app.

An account that answered `unauthenticated`, with no other account of its agent
signed in, gets a `Sign in again` chip beside
the model chip, and an error in its thread carries the same button. Both open
the dialog on that account, so the login lands on it instead of creating a
second one; a default-location account, which Boite never logs in, is told to
sign in from the agent's own window and check again, unless its login runs in a
terminal, which is then the user's own CLI answering. A paired phone gets
neither button and reads `No AI connected` on the chip: `accounts.*` and
`providers.install` are the owner's.

## Signing in from a terminal

Some login commands are a menu drawn in the terminal: `opencode auth login`
asks which provider to add, with arrow keys, a search field and a key to paste.
Piped output turns that into escape codes and gives the user nothing to answer
with. A descriptor that sets `login.terminal: true` gets a real shell instead,
the same one as the thread terminal ([terminal.md](terminal.md)):

1. `accounts.loginTerminal` starts the shell in a pseudo-terminal under
   `login:<accountId>`, with the account's environment and the isolation
   directory (or the home directory for the default account) as its working
   directory. Calling it again attaches to the running one.
2. On Windows, once the prompt goes quiet, the core types the login command
   into it, as the user would have: `& 'C:\path\opencode.exe' auth login` in
   PowerShell. On Linux and macOS, `/bin/sh -c` runs the command with its
   arguments as given, then `exec`s the user's shell: a profile still reading
   its input cannot swallow typed keys.
3. The Providers card draws the shell under the provider's row. The user
   answers the CLI there and closes the terminal once signed in, or types `exit`.
4. When the shell exits, the core rechecks the account and `accounts.updated`
   follows. `accounts.loginCancel` closes the shell too.

The default account may sign in this way, unlike a piped login: the command runs
in plain view, in the user's own CLI, which is what they would have typed in a
terminal of their own. A sign-in from a row goes to the default account first
when it is not signed in, then to an isolated account nobody is signed into,
then to a new one. OpenCode and Grok use it; the phone has no Providers card
and no terminal.

## What the core refuses, and why

- The provider has no `login` block. Nothing to run, so the answer is a refusal
  naming the provider rather than a spinner. pi is the shipped example: its login
  is a slash command inside its own interface, with no command-line equivalent.
- A login is already running for that account. One at a time, or two processes
  race on one credentials file.
- The account uses the provider's own default location and the login is piped.
  That login is the user's own CLI, outside Boite, and running it unseen would
  write into the real configuration directory the user is logged into. The
  refusal says so. A terminal login is the exception above.
- `accounts.loginTerminal` for a provider without `login.terminal`, or while a
  piped login runs for that account. Refused by name, with the field.
- The login command is empty, or its executable does not resolve. Refused at the
  spawn, naming what was tried.
- An account of its own, for a provider whose profile has no isolation variable
  and no login block. Such an account would run on the user's own login anyway,
  so `accounts.add` refuses it, names the profile's `isolation` field and says to
  use the default account. No shipped provider is such a case.

The account controls display each refusal with its field and reason.

## Removing an account

`accounts.remove` deletes the account and emits `accounts.removed`, which also
drops every probe cached for it, since a probe's answer belongs to one login. The
descriptor's `close.processes` names what to close first, which matters for an
agent that keeps a background process on its configuration directory. An account
that runs under `node` names nothing there, because the process in the job is
`node` and killing every `node` on the machine is not a thing Boite will ever do.
The shared links are removed before the directory, so deleting the account
never walks into the user's own `skills` or `plugins`.

Conversations that name the account stay, archived ones included. `accounts.threads`
counts them, and the confirmation says how many before anything is deleted. Such a
conversation keeps its history and its title, and its mode can still change. Its
next turn moves it to another account of the agent
([below](#a-conversation-follows-its-agent)). A model change, and a turn when the
agent has no other account to run on, are refused with `field: accountId` until
`threads.update` gives it one; the composer then shows an Account removed chip
that opens the model picker.

## Transcripts Boite removes

A Claude account Boite created keeps its sessions as
`<dataDir>/accounts/<id>/projects/<folder>/<sessionId>.jsonl`, with a
`<sessionId>/` folder beside it for subagent sidechains. When a deleted
conversation is purged, or an incognito one is erased (by the user, when the
core stops, or by the next core after one died with it open),
`packages/core/src/threads/transcript-purge.ts` removes both for every session
the conversation's turns named, current and earlier. It acts only where
`ownIsolationDir` in `packages/core/src/accounts.ts` holds: the account's
directory is exactly `<dataDir>/accounts/<id>` and not a link. A default account,
whose directory is the user's own `~/.claude`, and an account pointed at a folder
the user chose are never touched. A session another conversation still names,
such as the source of a fork, stays: the journal is asked again right before
each path goes, since the disk is awaited between paths. A session being
imported is left alone, and an import of a session whose transcript is being
removed is refused. Links inside `projects` are skipped.

Only the `claude-sdk` driver is covered. Codex and pi file their sessions by date
or under an id Boite does not keep, so their transcripts stay where the agent
wrote them. A path that cannot be listed, read or removed, other than a missing
one, is reported in one `warn` line per pass and never holds the purge back.

## A conversation follows its agent

A thread records the account its last turn used, yet that account does not hold
it hostage. `packages/core/src/threads/account-fallback.ts` holds the rule, and
the in-memory client mirrors it:

- When a turn starts on a thread whose account was removed or reads
  `unauthenticated`, the core moves it to another account of the same provider:
  signed in (`ok`) first, then `unknown`, then `error`. The move is the
  `threads.update` switch the model picker makes, so the native session of the
  old login goes and the turn starts a fresh one with the journal's context.
  The model, effort and speed stay when the new account lists them, else the
  model alone, else the provider's default model.
- With no other account able to run, a removed account is refused as above and
  a signed-out one names itself in the turn's check, as before.
- A title for such a thread is written on the account its next turn would use.
- A bot keeps the account its profile names.

The composer follows the same rule. A draft opens on the remembered account
while it is signed in, else on another of that provider. The picker shows a
provider's models for its first signed-in account, and a signed-out account
chip cannot be picked; it signs in again from Providers. `Sign in again` and
Account removed appear only when no other account of the agent can take the
next turn.

## Provider controls and account pools

Settings > AI accounts > Providers shows installation and sign-in steps, account labels and
identities, Check connection, Rename, Remove, Add another account and Use my
command-line login. Default-location accounts keep their external login.
The provider's default model and effort are device preferences. This page shows
no usage or quotas; [Usage and Limits](usage.md) owns quota sources, freshness,
credit balances, confirmed banked resets, monitoring and the tray window.
Empty subscription usage keeps the last known limits marked stale and retries
after five minutes. A disabled paid-usage flag alone does not report quota data.

[Plugins](plugins.md) can manage external CLI account pools. Boite does not
rotate accounts automatically or relay provider requests.

## Moving a login to Douane

Settings can hand this machine's logins to a Douane gateway
([providers](providers.md#moving-connections-to-douane)): the core reads each
account's login file from the location above, its isolation directory or the
CLI's default one, and posts it to Douane. Nothing is deleted here and the
account stays as it is.

It is a move, not a copy. Claude, Codex and Grok refresh tokens rotate: the
first time Douane refreshes a login it received, the refresh token Boite still
holds stops working. While the proxy is on, that does not matter, since the
gateway serves the provider and the local account only lends its name. Turned
off later, the proxy gives the account back with a dead login, which reads
signed out at its next refusal: sign in again from Providers. OpenCode API
keys and a GitHub Copilot sign-in do not rotate and keep working in both
places. A test core (`BOITE_HOST_AGENTS=0`) lists isolated accounts only and
never reads the user's own CLI logins.
