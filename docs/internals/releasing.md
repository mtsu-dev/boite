# Releasing

This guide owns release channels, artifact layout and signing. Run build
commands from the repository root. [Development](development.md) owns local
setup and test commands; [portability](portability.md) records platform limits.

[CI and publication](ci.md) covers automated checks, draft releases, Docker
images and the daily nightly schedule.

## The order

Run the [development checks](development.md#checks-and-tests) and
`bun run check:translations` before packaging. Then:

```bash
bun run build:shell
bun run apps/shell/scripts/stage-sidecar.ts
bun run e2e
```

`build:shell` builds the UI and compiles the core through `stage:core`. The
staging command after it copies that existing core beside the newly built shell;
it does not compile again. The end-to-end suite refuses missing or stale artifacts.

## What each step produces

Linux CI also writes a signed `boite-server_<version>_<arch>.zip` for x64 and
ARM64, containing the compiled core, CLI shim, UI and embedded release version.
`scripts/ci/server-bundle.ts` creates it and Tauri's signer signs the payload
with the desktop updater key and release version. Both stable and nightly
publication require those signatures, include the archives in the checksums,
and add separate server targets to `latest.json`. Docker images remain separate.
The same x64 job writes `boite-server_<version>_android.zip` for phones: the
core's scripts, the UI and the Termux controller, which run on Bun's Android
build. It is signed and listed the same way, under the `android-aarch64-server`
target ([Android server](android-server.md#releases-and-updates)).

The nightly also attaches the signed Android app as
`boite-android-<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>.apk`. That version belongs to the app, not
to the release: `apps/android/VERSION` holds `MAJOR.MINOR`, raised by hand, and
the patch grows by one only when the APK is rebuilt. A release with no change
to the app attaches the previous APK under its original name.
[Android](android.md#the-app-version) has the full rule. Boite Server, the app
that runs a core on a phone, comes beside it as
`boite-server-android-<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>.apk` under the same rule, counted from
`apps/android-server/VERSION` ([Android server](android-server.md#publishing-the-app)).

- `build:ui` writes `packages/ui/dist`. That directory is what the core serves at
  `/`, with a `.br` and a `.gz` copy beside each text asset. The Tauri config
  runs it as its own before-build command, so a shell build never ships a UI
  older than the sources, then `apps/shell/scripts/stage-frontend.ts` copies it
  to `apps/shell/dist` without those compressed copies. That copy is the
  shell's `frontendDist`, embedded in the executable: the window never asks for
  the `.br` and `.gz` files, which took 2 MB of it. The installed `ui/`
  directory, which the core serves to phones, stays the complete dist.
- `build:core` cleans and writes `packages/core/dist`: `main.js`, `jobs-worker.js`,
  `guard-worker.js`, `artifact-retention-worker.js`, and hashed chunks for the main module and lazy drivers.
  Keep every emitted file together when distributing this bundle. Lazy imports
  keep the SDKs off the start path. `bun run core` and the shell both prefer this
  bundle over the sources when it is there.
  `packages/core/bin/build.ts` runs it and passes the build's kind and its
  features as `--define` flags, read from the version in the core's
  `package.json`, as `vite.config.ts` does for the UI and `bin/compile.ts` for
  the compiled core: a Release bundle holds no code of a feature tagged
  `nightly` or `dev`, the Contacts' core side aside
  ([out of the build](experiments.md#out-of-the-build)).
- `build:core:exe` compiles `packages/core/dist/boite-core`, with `.exe` on Windows. On x64 it embeds
  Bun's baseline runtime, which needs no AVX2. That runtime, and the other
  architecture's in a cross build, is not the running Bun, and `bun build
  --target` would fetch it from npm with no deadline. `packages/core/bin/bun-runtime.ts`
  fetches it instead from the release of the running Bun, failing after 30 s
  without data or 300 s in all, checks it against `SHASUMS256.txt`, keeps it under
  `node_modules/.cache/boite-bun-runtime/<target>-v<version>` with the SHA-256
  of the unpacked runtime, rechecked at each use (a copy that differs is fetched
  again), and `compile.ts` passes it with `--compile-executable-path`; the compile itself
  stops after 10 minutes. The jobs and guard workers remain
  JavaScript files beside the core. `artifact-retention-worker.ts` is also a
  compile entry point, so standalone signed server archives embed it and need
  no separate retention worker file. Shell staging still ships all three
  emitted worker files beside the sidecar.
- On Windows the installed sidecar is not that executable. It is Bun's baseline
  runtime of the version the build ran under, copied as `boite-core.exe`, with every file of the bundle
  but the workers in a `core` directory beside it, and the shell starts it as
  `boite-core.exe core/main.js`. The baseline build runs on x64 CPUs without
  AVX2, where the default one stops at its first instruction. `stage-sidecar.ts`
  downloads it once from the Bun release, checks the archive against the
  release's `SHASUMS256.txt` and keeps it under `node_modules/.cache`, so the
  first staging needs the network. The runtime carries its publisher's signature;
  the [2026-09-19 Windows comparison](../../bench/results/2026-09-29-resources.md#runtime-and-bundle-measurements-2026-09-19-to-2026-09-29)
  recorded about 650 ms of additional startup inspection for an unsigned core.
  Because the checksum comes from the same release, staging also verifies the
  signature: `stage-sidecar.ts` refuses a
  runtime whose signature is not valid or whose signer is not Bun's publisher
  (`O=Codeblog CORP`, `apps/shell/scripts/runtime-signature.ts`). It checks the
  cached copy again at every staging and downloads it again when that copy
  fails. It also refuses a Bun other than the `packageManager` pin, as do
  `packages/core/bin/compile.ts` and `build:core:linux`, since each ships the
  Bun it runs under. `BOITE_ALLOW_BUN_MISMATCH=1` allows another one for a build
  that is not shipped. `apps/shell/scripts/tauri.ts` adds
  `tauri.bundle.windows.conf.json`, which names the `core` directory as a
  resource, to any Windows build that passes the bundle overlay.
- `stage:core` builds the core with `apps/shell/scripts/build-core.ts`, then
  stages it. On Windows that build is `build:core` alone: the sidecar is the
  runtime, so the compiled `boite-core.exe` was a 105 MB write nothing read.
  Elsewhere it is `build:core:exe`. It then puts the sidecar, all three workers and the two `boite` shims
  (`packages/core/shims`, see [cli.md](cli.md)) where the two things that
  run them look. The bundler wants
  `apps/shell/src-tauri/binaries/boite-core-<target triple>`, with `.exe` on Windows, for
  `bundle.externalBin`, plus the workers and the `boite` shims in that same directory for the resource
  entries that land them beside the installed sidecar. The end to end suite wants
  the same files beside `apps/shell/src-tauri/target/release/boite-shell`, with
  `.exe` on Windows, so the script copies there whenever that executable exists.
  The Windows shell refuses a sidecar missing any worker and names the missing file.
- `build:shell` runs the Tauri build with the bundle overlay and produces the
  NSIS installer on Windows, Debian and AppImage packages on Linux, or an
  application bundle and DMG on macOS. Build on the target OS and architecture;
  staging supports Windows x64 and Linux/macOS x64 and ARM64. On Apple Silicon,
  `BOITE_TARGET=x86_64-apple-darwin` builds the Intel core, sidecar and bundle
  instead, as CI does.

A published shell is built with fat LTO over one codegen unit:
`desktop.yml` sets `CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=fat` and
`CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_CODEGEN_UNITS=1` when `sign-updates` is on, and
neither otherwise. Local builds and pull requests keep Cargo's release
defaults, since that final step is serial ([CI](ci.md#build-cost)). `panic` stays `unwind`, which the update
commands' `catch_unwind` needs, and nothing is stripped: the Windows symbols
stay in the PDB beside the build, which a hang dump needs to name the frames.
To reproduce the shipped executable locally:

```powershell
$env:CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO = 'fat'
$env:CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_CODEGEN_UNITS = '1'
bun run --cwd apps/shell tauri build --no-bundle
```

Measured on 2026-10-17 with `bun run --cwd apps/shell tauri build --no-bundle`
on the same base:

| build | `boite-shell.exe` bytes | embedded `.br`/`.gz` names |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Cargo defaults, full `packages/ui/dist` | 20,631,552 | 246 |
| thin LTO, filtered UI | 17,369,088 | 0 |
| fat LTO, filtered UI | 16,665,088 | 0 |

The thin and fat rows were built with those variables (`thin` for the first).

The shell passes Tauri's resource directory to the core through `BOITE_UI_DIR`,
so the installed core can serve the phone UI from the macOS application bundle
and Linux package. Windows workers are required only by the Windows shell.
Neither form of the sidecar needs a separately installed Bun runtime.
Linux builds also need `xdg-utils`, alongside the WebKitGTK and appindicator
development packages. The Debian package declares `xdg-utils` for opening links.
Install `patchelf` too. The shell build wrapper selects it from PATH for
linuxdeploy. On ARM64 it preserves the compiled Bun sidecar, whose ELF load
segments break after an RPATH rewrite. The exception checks that the sidecar
only needs glibc libraries; CI compares the packaged core with the original.
The AppImage bundler downloads AppRun and linuxdeploy from GitHub releases on
every run. CI retries the bundle up to three times when that download answers a
5xx (a 500 failed the 2026-10-14 nightly); any other bundling error fails at once.

Portable CI runs `scripts/ci/desktop-smoke.ts <installed-shell>` against the
Debian package, extracted AppImage and macOS application bundle. Signing, notarization and testing
on older operating systems remain release prerequisites; a local unsigned
bundle is not a notarized download. Native notifications and Windows process
guards are not implemented on Linux or macOS.
The [architecture](architecture.md#closing-and-restart) describes resident-core
shutdown. Installed smoke tests use a temporary home, run outside the checkout
without Bun on PATH, and verify an echo turn executing `boite where`.
[Platform readiness](portability.md) separates that coverage from native webview,
notification, provider-login and older-OS checks.

macOS requires 13.0 or newer and includes the JIT entitlements needed by the
[compiled Bun runtime](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/executables). CI starts an
ad-hoc signed bundle when Developer ID/notarization credentials are absent.

A shell executable with no installer, for a quick look at the window:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/shell tauri build --no-bundle
```

## The bundle overlay

`apps/shell/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` is the base config without a sidecar.
`tauri.bundle.conf.json` adds `bundle.externalBin` and the resource map for the
core, Windows workers, CLI shims and built UI. The base can build before core
compilation; distributable builds use the overlay.

```json
{
  "bundle": {
    "externalBin": ["binaries/boite-core"],
    "resources": {
      "binaries/jobs-worker.js": "jobs-worker.js",
      "binaries/guard-worker.js": "guard-worker.js",
      "binaries/artifact-retention-worker.js": "artifact-retention-worker.js",
      "binaries/boite": "boite",
      "binaries/boite.cmd": "boite.cmd",
      "../../../packages/ui/dist": "ui"
    }
  }
}
```

CLI `--config` paths resolve from `apps/shell`, while paths inside the configs
resolve from `src-tauri`. A directory resource preserves its tree under the
mapped name, giving `ui/index.html`; a glob would flatten it. Windows adds a
separate resource overlay for the split `core/` JavaScript bundle and
`boite.exe`.

## Channels

Boite and Boite Nightly are update tracks of the same installed application.
They share `com.boite.two`, the Boite installer name and the `boite2` data
directory. Nightly uses `icons-nightly/`, the white mark on violet and magenta, and
displays boite (de nuit) in the window title and tray. The in-app channel selector downloads the selected
track, including an older stable version when leaving nightly.
[Desktop updates](updates.md) covers restart behavior and data compatibility.

A Release carries a plain version (`2.0.0`); a Nightly and a build from source
carry a prerelease one (`2.0.0-nightly.20261111.1`, `2.0.0-beta.1`). That is
what separates them at run time: [experiments](experiments.md) do not exist in
a Release, in the app or in the core, and nothing else has to be set when a
version is cut.

Boite Dev remains a separate development install. It uses `com.boite.two.dev`,
the product name Boite Dev and `boite2-dev`, with no automatic app updates.

The build commands:

```bash
bun run build:shell         # Boite, com.boite.two, boite2
bun run build:shell:nightly # nightly overlay; CI stamps the nightly version
bun run build:shell:dev     # Boite Dev, com.boite.two.dev, boite2-dev
```

The dev build passes a second overlay, `apps/shell/src-tauri/tauri.dev.conf.json`,
after the bundle one. The Tauri CLI takes `--config` more than once and merges
in the order given, so the dev overlay carries only what differs: the product
name, the identifier, the main binary name and `bundle.icon` pointing at
`icons/`, the black mark on white. The release uses `icons-dev/`, the white
mark on black. These asset directory names are historical. Two identifiers
mean two NSIS product codes, so the second installer installs beside the first
instead of over it.

Boite Dev's window is `boite-dev-shell.exe` (`mainBinaryName`), Boite's stays
`boite-shell.exe`. Tauri renames the executable Cargo built (`boite-shell`)
before bundling, so after `build:shell:dev` the Cargo target holds
`boite-dev-shell.exe` and no `boite-shell.exe`: the end to end suite and
`stage:core` never pick up a Dev shell. The installers close only the shell
running from their own directory (see [Desktop updates](updates.md)), and a Boite Dev
installed before the rename is updated in place: its `boite-shell.exe` is
closed and deleted, and its links and login entry move to the new file.

The shell derives its channel from the identifier's `.dev` suffix and passes
`--channel dev` to its core. Shell and core must select the same directory:
otherwise a development shell can adopt a stable core and journal. Stable and
nightly share the regular WebView2 profile; Boite Dev has its own. Core adoption
and version/hash checks belong to the [architecture](architecture.md).

## Signed update artifacts

Release and nightly callers enable `BOITE_SIGN_UPDATES=1` and provide
`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` through the CI secret. The Tauri wrapper adds
`tauri.updater.conf.json`, which enables `createUpdaterArtifacts`, and refuses
signing without a key. Normal local builds and the Windows PR build remain
unsigned. The Linux and macOS CI builds always sign: a PR or main push uses a
throwaway key generated on the runner, so every run proves the payloads and
signatures a release will need; only release callers use the real key.

The public verification key is in `tauri.conf.json`. Keep the matching private
key backed up outside the repository: replacing the public key strands clients
that only trust the old one. No private key belongs in an artifact or Git.

The Windows build uploads the installer and its `.sig`. Each Linux and macOS
runner collects its packages with `scripts/ci/desktop-bundles.ts` into a
`desktop-bundle-<platform>` artifact, such as `desktop-bundle-macos-x64`: the
.deb and AppImage with their `.sig` on Linux, the DMG and the updater archive
`Boite.app.tar.gz` with its `.sig` on macOS. That archive has the same name on both Mac architectures, so the script
renames it after the DMG beside it (`Boite_<version>_aarch64.app.tar.gz`). It
fails the runner when a payload or a signature is missing or when a file of
another architecture is present. Publication gathers every artifact, and
`scripts/ci/updater-manifest.ts` creates `latest.json` with the exact version,
publication date, release notes, and one signature and immutable release
download URL per updater target. It requires all nine targets: Windows x64,
two macOS architectures, Linux .deb/AppImage on both architectures, and two
standalone Linux server archives. Unknown release files are refused. DMGs are
manual downloads. `SHA256SUMS.txt` covers desktop/server payloads; stable
publication also includes tested-image provenance metadata. Stable releases
remain drafts until reviewed; nightlies publish automatically. The desktop
updater excludes drafts and unsigned older releases.

Docker publication reuses the tested image digests. Version tags identify the
release; the shared `sha-<full commit>` alias can change between stable and
nightly builds of the same source. Use a version tag or digest to pin a build.
Stable `latest` promotion runs separately under a repository-wide concurrency
group and rechecks GitHub's current stable release before writing the alias.

These are Tauri updater signatures, not Windows Authenticode signatures or
Apple Developer ID signatures.

A release or nightly signs the macOS application with a Developer ID and
notarizes it when six repository secrets are set: `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` (the
Developer ID Application `.p12`, base64), `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`,
`APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, and the App Store Connect API key used for
notarization, `APPLE_API_ISSUER`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` and
`APPLE_API_PRIVATE_KEY` (the `.p8` contents). The CI then checks the stapled
ticket and Gatekeeper's verdict on the bundle. Without all six, and on every
pull request, the bundle is signed ad hoc and Gatekeeper asks once before the
first start ([installation notes](portability.md#installing-a-release)). Developer ID signing and notarization need the Apple
Developer Program. Linux
packages are built on Ubuntu 22.04, whose glibc 2.35 is the oldest a user can
run them on.

## What the installer holds

The bundle target is NSIS, the identifier is `com.boite.two` and the product
name is `Boite`. The install is per user and asks for no elevation.
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Boite` ends up holding:

- `boite-shell.exe`, the window and the tray icon (`boite-dev-shell.exe` in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Boite Dev`).
- `boite-core.exe`, the sidecar it starts: Bun's baseline runtime under the core's name.
  Run by hand with no script it is `bun`, so a subcommand goes after the bundle:
  `boite-core.exe core\main.js pair --owner`.
- `core/`, the bundled core that runtime runs: `main.js` and its lazy chunks.
- `jobs-worker.js`, beside the core because that is where the core looks for it.
  Without it the trace reports `poll` instead of `events`.
- `guard-worker.js`, the focus guard and the audio mute.
- `artifact-retention-worker.js`, the background scan for unused deliverables.
- `boite` and `boite.cmd`, the CLI shims the core puts on an agent's PATH; each
  invokes the adjacent core's CLI entry ([cli.md](cli.md)).
- `boite.exe`, the same CLI without cmd.exe, which Windows finds first; built
  from `apps/shell/launcher` by `stage-sidecar.ts`. Once the core has stopped,
  the installer moves aside a copy an agent's command still holds.
- `ui/`, the same build a phone gets over the pairing link.

`core/` and `ui/` hold only the current build. Their file names carry a hash,
and the template only copies files and deletes the ones a build lists, so each
update used to leave the previous build's chunks beside the new ones and an
uninstall left them all: an install updated since 2026-09-28 held 3,614 files
and 243 MB, about 108 MB of them stale. Once the core of that install has
stopped, the installer hook moves both directories aside to `core.previous` and
`ui.previous` before the copy, deletes them when the install completes and puts
them back when it fails (a full disk halfway through), so the previous core
still finds its chunks (`windows/hooks.nsh`). The uninstall hook removes both
directories, once before the template's deletions and once after, since
`RMDir /r` skips a file still held open without failing; what is still held
then goes at the next restart where Windows allows it. Nothing else in the
install directory is touched.

The installer packs with zlib, not Tauri's default LZMA: it is 70 MB rather
than 55 MB, and it writes the files in 2.3 seconds rather than 5.2 on the
machine measured, which is time an in-app update spends with no window
([app update restart](performance.md#app-update-restart)).

The identifier is fresh, so Boite installs beside Boite Legacy rather than over
it. To see the exact file list a build produced, read
`apps/shell/src-tauri/target/release/nsis/x64/installer.nsi` before installing
anything: it names every file and where it goes.

## How the shell finds a core

[Architecture](architecture.md#the-core-is-the-host-the-shell-is-a-client)
owns core adoption and residency; [portability](portability.md) records shutdown
limits. [Desktop updates](updates.md#download-and-restart) owns installer
admission, running-core replacement and shortcut preservation.

Core lookup order:

1. `BOITE_CORE_COMMAND`, split on whitespace. This is the override the tests and
   the bench use.
2. `boite-core.exe` beside the shell executable, given `core/main.js` as its
   script when that file is beside it too. This is the installed case, and
   it is also what the end to end suite drives, which is why a stale staged
   sidecar is refused rather than tolerated.
3. `packages/core/dist/main.js` through bun, when a repository root is found
   above the executable. The development case with a built bundle.
4. `packages/core/src/main.ts` through bun. The development case without one.

## Installed-shell diagnostics

Close exits the shell by default; General settings can keep it in the tray.
`<dataDir>/shell-settings.json` stores that choice. Tray Quit always exits; Show
restores the main window. Hover/click opens a quota popup that polls only while
visible and is destroyed 45 seconds after hiding. Hidden/minimized Windows
pages and browser panels stop painting and see `document.hidden`.

General settings can also start the shell at login with `--autostart`: a
quoted `Run` value named after the product under
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`, an XDG
`<identifier>.desktop` (the `$APPIMAGE` file for an AppImage) or a LaunchAgent
`<identifier>.plist`. That start runs the core and keeps the window in the tray;
with no tray, or after an update restart, the window shows. On Windows the
installer restarts the shell with its old arguments, `--autostart` included,
and adds `--after-update`, which shows the window. The switch reads
off when the entry names another executable or Task Manager disabled it, and
switching it on rewrites both. The NSIS uninstaller deletes the `Run` value;
updates keep it. Hidden test shells refuse to change it
(`src/autostart.rs`, `src/platform/login.rs`).

`shell.lock` permits one shell per data directory. A second launch uses the
loopback port/token in `shell-wake` to show the existing window. Hidden test
shells never request it. Setup failures and panics go to `shell-error.log`;
visible setup failures name that file in a dialog. Missing WebView2 uses Tauri's
dialog. A tray-creation failure leaves a usable window that exits on Close.

The shell also writes `logs/shell.0.ndjson` to `shell.3.ndjson` under the data
directory, 1 MiB each, in the core's record format with `origin: "shell"`
(`src/shell_log.rs`). A background thread does the writing from a queue of 1024
records; a full queue drops records and the next line counts them. Records
cover startup phases with their duration, the OS build and WebView version,
core attach, spawn, readiness, exits and restarts, window and tray actions,
updater steps, panics and, on Windows, WebView2 `ProcessFailed` events. A
command that holds the main thread over 250 ms is a `debug` line, over 2 s a
`warn`. A watchdog posts a no-op to the main thread every second
(`src/watchdog.rs`). When 5 s pass without an answer it writes one
`shell.main-thread.blocked` error naming the running command or the last
window event, plus `IsHungAppWindow` on Windows and the main thread's id. While
the thread stays blocked it writes `shell.main-thread.still-blocked` errors at
30 s, 2 min, 10 min and then every 30 min, with `blockedMs` counted from the
episode's start and the same fields, so a shell Windows kills at shutdown still
leaves how long it hung. On Windows each of these lines also lists the
processes that own windows inside the main window (WebView2's browser process
hosts the page there) and whether each one is hung: `foreignProcesses`,
`foreignWindows`, `foreignHungWindows`. The first still-blocked line with the
window reported hung starts a minidump of the shell, written from a thread of
its own as `logs/shell-hang-<UTC time>.dmp` (thread info, handles, unloaded
modules); the line names it in `dumpPath`, and `shell.main-thread.dumped` or
`shell.main-thread.dump-failed` follows. One dump per run, and the two newest
are kept. The stack of `mainThreadId` needs the PDB of the same build to show names.
When the thread answers, one `shell.main-thread.recovered` warning gives the
total blocked time.

Resident cores append to `core-output.log`, truncated at startup above 8 MiB.
`BOITE_CORE_RESIDENT=0` makes a Windows shell own its core through a
`KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` Job Object. POSIX gives its owned core three seconds for
SIGTERM before forcing exit. [Updates](updates.md) owns the installer hooks
that close the shell before replacing its running core.

## Icons

The app icon source is `packages/ui/public/icons/icon.svg`. The light shell
icon set and the two PWA pngs are rendered from it, the first through the Tauri CLI's
own icon command from `apps/shell`. Nothing else draws the mark, and the UI's own
copy of it is a Svelte component using `currentColor`.

The release uses the inverted `packages/ui/public/icons/icon-dev.svg`, rendered
into its own directory. Remove the Android/iOS outputs of the icon command,
as for the light set:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/shell tauri icon ../../packages/ui/public/icons/icon-dev.svg -o src-tauri/icons-dev
```

Nightly keeps the white mark on a ground lit from below, near-black violet at
the top fading to magenta, with a faint halo around the mark.
`packages/ui/public/icons/icon-nightly.svg` renders into `src-tauri/icons-nightly`
with the same command and the same cleanup.

## Version numbers

The version lives in the root `package.json`, each workspace package,
`apps/shell/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `apps/shell/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.
Update them together and refresh the package entry in `Cargo.lock` in the same
release commit.

## Before handing a build to anyone

Run `bun run e2e` on the staged build, not on the sources alone: it is the only
thing that drives the real shell executable over its debugging port, hidden.
Then run `bun run bench` and `bun run bench/idle-rss.ts` fresh, so the resource
figures in the release notes come from the build being released and carry its
date. The idle bench reports two points for each process: `fresh`, 4.5 s after
the spawn, and `steady`, 75 s after it, once the first automatic update check
has run. Quote both, with the working set, private bytes and thread count it
prints. The bench starts its cores with `BOITE_HOST_AGENTS=0`, so by default
the check finds no provider and the steady point measures an empty check. For
the notes, a person runs it with `BOITE_BENCH_HOST_AGENTS=1`, so the update
check reads the providers installed on the machine as a user's core would, and
says which providers those were. An agent never sets it: the check runs each
agent's `--version`, and an agent's own updater can open a console window.

## Release notes

The release and nightly workflows pass their downloaded artifact directories to
`scripts/ci/changelog.ts`. The generated notes start with direct download links
grouped by platform: Windows x64, macOS Apple Silicon/Intel, Linux x64/ARM64,
and Android when its APKs are attached. Linux rows offer Debian/Ubuntu packages
and AppImages. A separate headless-server table links the Linux and Termux
archives. Signatures, the updater's macOS archives and `latest.json` stay out
of these tables.

Links use the exact attached filenames and the release tag, so a reused Android
APK keeps its independent app version. An absent artifact never gets a link.
Nightly notes open with an instability warning and a reminder to back up data.
The tables precede the optional announcement and automatic changelog.

Release notes come from Git commits, including commits without a pull request.
Each subject links to its commit, and a comparison link opens the complete diff.
Each line ends with its author and its `Co-authored-by` trailers: a GitHub
noreply address becomes `@login`, which GitHub links and lists among the
release's contributors; any other address shows the commit's name.
Merge commits are excluded because the commits they merge are already listed.
Subjects starting with `feat`, `fix` and `perf` get their own sections; every
other subject goes under "Other changes". A list with no typed subject has no
headings.

For a stable release, the range starts at the previous published stable release
reachable from that commit. A prerelease may start at a previous prerelease.
Nightlies compare with the previous published nightly. Drafts and releases from
unrelated branches never become the baseline. The first release includes the
repository's history.

The manual release and nightly forms accept an optional `announcement`. It
appears below the downloads and above the generated changelog. Leave it empty
for fully automatic notes. Retrying an existing draft refreshes its artifacts
and generated notes, including download links; put an announcement in the input
to retain it on retries. The workflow refuses to replace a published release
or a tag pointing at another commit.
