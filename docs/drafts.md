# Drafts

Drafts use a project in the core machine's Documents folder, `Documents/Boite`.
Each conversation gets its own working directory without requiring a project
folder first. The [tour](onboarding.md#the-question) sets the device's starting
project preference.

## Where a draft lives

- A new device opens a draft there. The first send calls `projects.drafts`,
  which makes the folder and the project once and answers the same project on
  every later call.
- Each conversation started there gets a folder of its own inside the drafts,
  named after the local day and the first words of its title:
  `2026-09-23 Plan the trip to Lisbon`. A second one with the same name on the
  same day becomes `2026-09-23 Plan the trip to Lisbon 2`. The agent runs in that
  folder, so what it writes stays with the conversation. The folder is never
  renamed, even when the title changes later.
- A name keeps only what a Windows folder can hold: `<>:"/\|?*` and control
  characters become spaces, the first six words are kept, cut at 60 characters.
  The date comes first, so a title can never make a reserved name like `CON`.
- The drafts folder is not a git repository. The worktree switch is hidden
  there, and `threads.create` with `worktree` on the drafts project is refused
  by name.

## Finding Documents

| Machine | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | What `SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_Documents)` answers, so a folder moved by OneDrive or by hand is followed. It costs 3 ms on first use (2026-09-23). |
| Linux | `XDG_DOCUMENTS_DIR` from `~/.config/user-dirs.dirs`, `$HOME` expanded; a value equal to the home means the desktop turned it off. |
| macOS, or anything unreadable | `~/Documents`. |

`BOITE_DRAFTS_DIR` replaces the whole path. The test harness and the e2e cores
set it inside their temporary data directory, so no test writes to a real
Documents folder.

## In the app

- The drafts show as `Drafts` in English and `Brouillons` in French, whatever
  name the core stored. `Project.kind` is `drafts` on that one project, read
  from the path on every answer.
- The draft heading's project menu lists the drafts first, made or not, then
  the projects, then `Open a folder` for the owner. Under the composer,
  `Work in a folder of mine` opens the same folder dialog.
- A paired phone may start a draft: `projects.drafts` is on the device list,
  since the core picks the folder and the device names no path.

If the device cannot read its unsent-message journal, it keeps new text in
memory and the synchronous backup, reports the storage failure and pauses
automatic PR archival on that machine connection. An empty composer cannot
delete a durable draft the device has not read. A successful read on the next
connection restores the text and releases protection for threads without input.
New text also reaches its synchronous entry backup while a read is still
pending, so cancelling the connection retains that input. The device waits to
read older entries before writing a complete durable journal; `flushDrafts`
reports failure until that read has succeeded.
A journal that is only slow is not a failure. Each journal operation waits
three seconds for IndexedDB to open, but the open itself has no deadline: a
cold WebView2 profile on a busy machine can take longer. When the first read
times out, the device starts from the synchronous backup and reads again while
the open carries on, then restores the durable text into the inputs nobody
typed in. An attachment the backup held only by its ID gets its bytes back
from the journal in every input, so the next checkpoint keeps them. The
storage error shows when the journal refuses, or is still
silent after ten seconds, unless another error is showing; a journal that
answers later clears that notice, but not a refused backup reported meanwhile,
and the reads stop after about a minute (`lib/store/drafts.svelte.ts`). Until then, a
refused synchronous backup is reported at once, since nothing else holds that
text.
The browser can close the journal's IndexedDB connection on its own (storage
pressure, site data cleared, a frozen tab). A `close` or `versionchange` event
drops the cached connection, and a read or write whose transaction is refused
with `InvalidStateError` opens a fresh connection and runs once more, so a
dropped connection costs one retry instead of failing every save until reload.
If neither IndexedDB nor the synchronous backup can save the input,
`flushDrafts` returns false and the input remains visible. A completed
IndexedDB write can succeed even when the synchronous backup is unavailable.

## Incognito

A conversation that should leave nothing behind starts incognito: turn on
`Incognito` at the right of the draft's header before the first send.
The switch is offered in the drafts only, and a draft taken to a project leaves
it behind.

- `threads.create` with `incognito: true` gives the thread a folder of the
  core's data directory, `incognito/<thread id>`, instead of a dated folder in
  Documents. It is refused on any other project, and with `cwd` or `worktree`.
  A paired phone may start one too: it can call `threads.remove`, so leaving
  erases it there as well.
- The thread carries `incognito: true`. The sidebar, the command palette and
  the phone's lists leave it out, and the device's unsent-text journal keeps
  nothing typed into it or into its draft.
- Leaving it erases it. Opening another thread or a new draft, archiving it or
  deleting it makes the client call `threads.remove`, and the core deletes its
  history, events included, and its folder at once. `thread.removed` says
  `undoable: false`, and the deleted list never shows it.
- A core that stops, or starts after a crash, erases every incognito
  conversation it still holds and the whole `incognito` folder.
- Its turns leave the usage page with it. The usage that a project removal or
  a purge keeps for the page ([usage](usage.md#usagehistory)) skips an
  incognito conversation and the threads it started.
- Forking or moving one is refused: either would keep a copy.

What the agent's own CLI writes outside that folder, such as its session
transcripts in its home directory, is out of Boite's reach and stays.
