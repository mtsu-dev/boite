# Wire and startup, 2026-09-19

Windows 11, Ryzen 7 9800X3D, Bun 1.4.2. "Before" is `main` at 21c1c06, built
and run from its own checkout; "after" is this branch. Both runs use the same
seed for conversation text.

## Bandwidth and latency behind a 150 ms round trip

```sh
bun run bench/bandwidth.ts --rtt 150 --sequence sequential --core <checkout of 21c1c06>/packages/core/src/main.ts
bun run bench/bandwidth.ts --rtt 150
```

The remote client has sixty threads in its sidebar and one 40 turn conversation
with 250 words per turn. KB measures data received by the client. Static files
were fetched with `accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd` over plain HTTP,
which used gzip.

| scenario | before KB | after KB | before ms | after ms |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| page load, cold cache | 684.4 | 258.7 | 320 | 317 |
| every other script and stylesheet | 231.2 | 85.9 | 157 | 162 |
| connect, hello and the boot calls | 41.8 | 4.4 | 464 | 463 |
| open the 40 turn thread, whole sequence | 155.7 | 33.0 | 764 | 157 |
| open it, until the messages are in hand | | | 307 | 156 |
| one streamed turn of 250 words | 13.7 in 37 reads | 6.6 in 13 reads | 711 | 715 |
| a turn on a thread not subscribed | 5.1 | 3.2 | 561 | 560 |
| thirty seconds idle, connected | 0 | 0 | | |
| reconnect: hello, boot and the open thread again | 202.0 | 6.1 | 1222 | 614 |

"Reads" counts the relay's receive callbacks. TCP may split or combine them,
so they indicate the trend in frame count rather than an exact count.

Page load time stayed similar because the relay adds latency without limiting
throughput. On a bandwidth-limited link, the client receives 426 KB less.

## Desktop startup

```sh
bun run bench/startup.ts --exe <boite-shell.exe> --runs 7
```

Each run used a hidden release shell with its compiled core beside it, a fresh
data directory and a fresh WebView2 profile. Values are medians of 7 runs,
in ms after process spawn.

| spawn to | before | after |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| core answering `/health` | 1304 | 1024 |
| first contentful paint | 594 | 621 |
| UI holding its data | 1411 | 1049 |

The compiled core alone took 791 ms (spawned by hand, 7 runs) of the remaining
1024 ms. About 650 ms passed before it ran its first line. See "The Windows
sidecar is the signed runtime" in [docs/internals/performance.md](../../docs/internals/performance.md).

## UI bundle

`bun run build:ui`, the entry chunk: 390.6 kB to 262.6 kB (gzip 121.3 to 81.2),
the entry stylesheet 117.7 kB to 91.3 kB.

## Idle core

`bun packages/core/src/main.ts` with no client used 16 to 125 ms of CPU over
30 s across runs on both branches, under 0.5 % of one core. This change did
not affect the idle core.
