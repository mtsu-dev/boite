 * answers, so a core needs nothing new and an older one simply lacks what it
 * cannot take.
 *
 * What follows is `SYNCED_SETTINGS`, the keybindings and the brain switches;
 * everything else stays on its own machine. What the target changed for
 * itself (`Settings.syncOverrides`) is skipped. Login tokens never cross
 * machines: a sign-in stays where it was made.
 *
 * Each end is read as it stores its settings (`settings.get` with `stored`).
 * A Release reads the settings that are experiments as off without touching
 * what is saved, so the home's reading must never reach a follower as a
 * choice: a Nightly follower would lose its own.
