 * What this app tells each core it is connected to about itself

 * (the core reads them for its own build, so a finished feature or a Release needs nothing said here)
 * and the names it gives settings in that language. An agent then reads the
 * screen the user reads (`boite settings`), and a card about an experiment
 * settles once this app reports the switch moved. Sent after every hello and
 * on every change; an older core without the method is left alone.
