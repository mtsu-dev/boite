/*
 * The experiments this build carries: work that is not finished and may change
 * or go away, turned on per machine from Settings, Experiments. The enabled ids
 * live in `localStorage` under `boite.experiments` as a JSON array of strings,
 * the way the theme lives under `boite.theme` and the window material under
 * `boite.glass`. These are client preferences, not core settings. A finished
 * experiment graduates to `features.ts`: on by default, switched in its own
 * Settings page.
 *
 * A phone or a browser follows the desktop app of its primary machine: the
 * core says which experiments that app has on (`client.preferences`,
 * `client.desktopExperiments`), and they are this device's until it flips a
 * switch of its own or turns following off.
 *
 * Nothing in this module imports a feature it gates. The dependency runs the
 * other way, `theme.ts` asks here whether `theme-grain` is on and subscribes so
 * a switch flipped on the Experiments page repaints without a reload, and the
 * sidebar, the palette and the store ask `experiments.svelte.ts` whether
 * `session-import` is on before showing or running the import, and the
 * context meter asks the same of `prompt-cache` before drawing its timer. The
 * bottom-left launchers and the store ask `resident-agents` before offering
 * the dedicated Agents interface.
