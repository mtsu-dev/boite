 * What the timeline's window counts and measures. A message is one row, except
 * the kind a long agent session leaves: an assistant message that carries a
 * whole turn of work, a thousand tool calls and more with a paragraph between
 * each run of them. Drawn as one block it was all mounted whenever any of it
 * was near the viewport, tens of thousands of pixels of it, and each scroll
 * across its edge built or tore down every part at once. Such a message is
 * cut into rows of about `ROW_PARTS` parts, each one measured and windowed
 * like a message of its own (docs/internals/performance.md, "A long turn is many rows").
 *
 * A cut falls only in front of a paragraph the page draws. An activity run
 * never spans it, so the rows draw exactly what the whole message drew, and
 * the gap above a continuing row is always the one a paragraph takes under
 * whatever came before it (`BLOCK_GAP`).
