 * of the timeline's window and comes back. The user can set the questions of a
 * thread aside to write an ordinary message instead.

 * A question never takes a composer the user is writing in: one that arrives
 * while its thread's composer holds a draft, or was typed in within the last
 * pause, waits until that composer is empty and quiet, so Enter sends the
 * draft as the message it was meant to be. The card can still choose it.
