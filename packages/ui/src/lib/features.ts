/*
 * Finished features this device can still switch off: former experiments that
 * graduated. They are on by default and their switches live in the Settings
 * page they belong to, not on the Experiments page. Only explicit choices are
 * stored, in `localStorage` under `boite.features` as a JSON object of ids to
 * booleans, so a feature nobody touched follows its default.
 *
 * Like `experiments.ts`, nothing here reaches the core and nothing here
 * imports a feature it gates.
 *
 * `open-chat-links` is the one that starts off: a click on a file link opens
 * the file's own app instead of Boite's preview, which is a taste, not a fix.
 * A device that turned on its experiment keeps it on: the first read stores
 * that as its choice, since the Experiments page drops ids it no longer lists
 * the next time it saves.
 *
 * `glass` is the look of the panes: on, the frame is tinted glass over a wash
 * of the accent and every menu is frosted; off, `data-panes="solid"` on the
 * root keeps every surface opaque (`theme.ts`, and `index.html` before the
 * stylesheet arrives).
