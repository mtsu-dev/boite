/*
 * A contact across the owner's group. A contact is linked to one machine of
 * the group, and the owner may open it projects that live on the others.
 *
 * The linked machine answers for them. It asks the member that holds the
 * project and hands the contact that member's threads under its own core id,
 * each thread id followed by `~` and the first 16 characters of the member's
 * core id. Legacy lookups keep the member name, address and key private.
 * Explicit shared-project associations additionally disclose canonical endpoint
 * fingerprints and their accepted directory labels, without forwarding owner RPC.
 *
 * The member keeps a copy of each contact it was opened to (`relayed`), with
 * the grants on its own projects, the owner's model tier and what the contact
 * opened in return, so its agents list the contact and its letters cross back
 * the same way. The linked machine pushes that copy at every change and
 * retries until the member heard it; each request it relays carries the
 * contact's current copy too, so a member that missed a push answers from
 * what is true now.
