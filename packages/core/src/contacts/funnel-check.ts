/*
 * Whether the internet reaches this core through Tailscale Funnel, asked the
 * way an invitee's machine would.
 *
 * Tailscale publishes a Funnel name in public DNS a few minutes after Funnel
 * is turned on, and sometimes not at all until it is turned off and on again.
 * This machine cannot see that by itself: MagicDNS answers its own tailnet
 * name with its tailnet address. So the name is asked of the servers that
 * hold the `ts.net` zone (`public-dns.ts`), which know it the moment it is
 * published, where a public resolver asked too early keeps "no such name"
 * for five minutes; DNS-over-HTTPS by public resolvers stands in on a network
 * that lets no DNS out. Then the join route is asked at one of the public
 * addresses they give, the TLS name still the Funnel one. A request with no
 * peer reaches `joinRequest`, which refuses it in its own words: that answer
 * is the proof the request went through Funnel to this core.
