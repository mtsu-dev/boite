/*
 * Boite's contact routes on the internet, through Tailscale Funnel.
 *
 * A machine share reaches another tailscale.com tailnet and nothing else: a
 * Headscale tailnet, or a machine with no Tailscale, never meets this one's
 * coordination server, so its core can neither resolve nor reach this
 * machine's tailnet name. Funnel gives that name a public HTTPS address. This
 * module mounts on it the routes a contact dials (the join, the link and the
 * signed letters) and no other route of the core. Everything on them is signed
 * and sealed already (`group/seal.ts`): TLS takes the place WireGuard had.
 *
 * Funnel opens a whole port to the internet, so the mounts take 8443 or 10000,
 * the first one that serves nothing else, never 443, which the phone's
 * `tailscale serve` uses. The owner's invitation for another network is the
 * consent; the mounts leave once no contact or invitation needs them
 * (`release`, from `ContactStore.relisten`). The CLI's own output never
 * reaches a client.
 *
 * While the mounts are up they are checked from the internet
 * (`funnel-check.ts`) until a request goes through, every 5 seconds for the
 * first 5 minutes, when Tailscale usually publishes the name, then every 30
 * seconds, for an hour at most. Tailscale may leave the name out of public DNS: still
 * unpublished 10 minutes after it was turned on, Funnel goes off and on again
 * once, which makes Tailscale publish it.
