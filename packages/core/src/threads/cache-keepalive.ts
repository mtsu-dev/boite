 * and restarts the lifetime, so the result that ends the wait is read from the
 * cache instead of written again in full.

 * checked again when it fires. A ping that missed the cache, the duration of
 * the setting, or as many pings as one miss would cost, ends the wait. A
 * result, a user message or a stop always wins: a ping never takes what was
