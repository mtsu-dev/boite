/**
 * A subagent is put away as done once it is over, so a conversation does not
 * keep every agent it ever started open:
 * - a delegated agent whose last turn ended done, once that result reached its parent;
 * - a workflow step's conversation, once its run is done, unless its parent
 *   sent it back to work: it then goes as a delegated agent does;
 * - a debater or a debate's summarizer, once its debate is over.
 * A persistent agent's next episode also archives the subagents of the last one.
 * One still watching its pull request is kept, with a marker when an episode
 * asked, and retires once the watch and its turn are over and its last result
 * reached the parent: a result not yet created would never be sent.
 *
 * A stopped or failed one stays, for `delegate resume`, and so does the rest of
 * an archived conversation's family, which its restore brings back as it was. A retired one carries
 * `doneAt`: its parent writing to it again brings it back (`revive`). One the
 * user reopens stays open until its next turn ends (`keep`).
