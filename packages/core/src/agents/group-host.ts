/*
 * This machine's side of a bot of another machine of the group that looks
 * after projects here (`group-bots.ts` is the bot's side). The owner turns
 * `groupBots` on in Settings, Machines; while it is off every `bot.*` request
 * is refused and nothing is sent. This machine's word is the one that counts:
 * the bot's core says which projects its owner entrusted (the lease), and this
 * one holds each request to those projects, to its own setting and to the
 * group as it stands now.
 *
 * What the bot may do here is what a bot of this machine does on a project
 * entrusted to it (`projects.ts`): list, read, steer with letters marked as
 * its own, answer questions, archive, mark done, stop, rename, move between
 * its projects, start a thread in one of them (`bot.start`, on the bot's desk
 * here at once). Deleting threads, tool permissions and settings are never
 * asked of this machine: there is no operation for them.
 *
 * Events go back by themselves: a turn of a thread it follows, any failed
 * turn, any question, a permission a followed thread waits on. They wait in a
 * bounded outbox per machine while it is away and leave once it answers.
