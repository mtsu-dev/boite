/**
 * The memory pass: after a turn of an agent's thread whose answer the user
 * sees, a small subagent of that thread reads MEMORY.md with what was asked
 * and answered, and returns the file rewritten. The core writes it, so the
 * subagent needs no file access and a provider without an approval channel
 * cannot leave it waiting on one.
 *
 * The subagent is a delegated child the core owns, like a goal reviewer: its
 * answer goes to the memory, never to the agent as mail. It runs with no tool
 * at all, enforced by its driver rather than asked in its prompt: no built-in
 * tool, MCP server, hook, instruction file or guide (`TOOL_FREE_CONTEXT`), a
 * permission mode that approves nothing, and a token that opens no method. A
 * driver that cannot drop every tool runs it in the most restricted mode it
 * has: `plan`, so Codex has a read-only sandbox with no network and asks
 * nothing, and Muse and ACP agents their plan mode; whatever tool it still asks
 * for is denied without a card. The agent's next turn
 * never waits for it. One pass runs per agent at a time; a turn that ends while
 * one runs is remembered and passed on once it ends. A pass runs on the
 * provider's small model (the one that writes thread titles) when the agent's
 * policy allows it, else on the agent's own model.
