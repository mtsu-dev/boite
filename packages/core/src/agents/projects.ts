/**
 * Projects the owner entrusted to a persistent agent (`AgentProfile.projectIds`).
 * Its thread reads every thread there, steers them with letters
 * marked as its own, answers what they ask, starts, moves, stops, renames and
 * archives them. Deleting threads and deciding tool permissions stay the
 * owner's. The core tells it what happens in those threads with facts that
 * gather into one `event` turn on its thread (`runtime.ts`).
 *
 * Every `resident.*` method carries the agent's own thread as `threadId`, so
 * the access gate already holds the token to it; the projects are read from
 * its profile at the moment of the call.
 *
 * Its desk is the threads it follows: those it started, wrote to, answered
 * for, was entrusted or put there itself. Facts about the threads it started,
 * was entrusted or watches wake it at once; those about a thread it only
 * wrote to or answered for (`touched`) wake it only with `eventWakes` on, and
 * wait for its next routine otherwise. A follow stays while the thread is
 * open and leaves a day after it is done or archived. A follow the agent made
 * through a project it looks after holds only while that project is still
 * entrusted to it: when the owner takes the project back it leaves the desk
 * with the facts it gathered, and every desk read, fact and context block
 * checks it again. A thread the owner entrusted or watched for the agent
 * stays: that is the owner's own grant. Besides their turns,
 * questions and permissions, the desk reports a running turn silent for
 * `STALL_MS` (once per turn), a pull request merged and checks that start to
 * fail.
