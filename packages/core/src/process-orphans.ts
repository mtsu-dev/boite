 * What a thread left running with nobody above it, by pid: a process whose
 * parent exited, or whose parent pid now names a younger process, past the
 * grace, with everything under it. A parent missing from the registry is
 * looked up in the system (`runningSince`), and one found running there keeps
 * its child. Whatever the core spawned has the core as its parent and is never taken.
 *
 * An exited `sh`, `bash`, `dash` or `zsh` that exited with 0, whose own parent
 * has its image and still runs, is a fork, not a shell: Git Bash (MSYS2) forks
 * a copy of the shell to exec each command, and that copy exits once the
 * command runs. Its child hangs from that live shell and stays while it runs,
 * so a background `sh wait.sh` keeps its shell. One exited fork is passed over,
 * never two: the `sleep` of a nested bash that exited or was stopped has the
 * fork and that bash dead above it, and goes. What an interrupted command left
 * goes too, since its shell is a different image from the agent above it, and
 * so does what an exited Node worker left under a live Node.
 *
 * The limit: a real subshell that exits with 0 while its own subshell runs
 * (`( trap 'exit 0' TERM; ( read ) & wait ) &` stopped by TERM) looks the
 * same from Windows, and so does a shell's nameless child that exits with 0:
 * what runs under them stays while the bash above runs. The
 * first sweep after that bash exits takes it, and a thread's stop kills its
 * whole job anyway.
