/*
 * The two PowerShell commands behind `firewall.status` and `firewall.allow`.
 *
 * On Windows the core is Bun's own signed runtime under the name
 * `boite-core.exe`, so the first time it listens outside loopback Windows asks
 * whether to let "Bun", published by "Oven", through, and creates block rules
 * before anybody answers. Dismissed, they stay. Allowed, the rule covers the
 * category of the network the machine was on then, public or private, and a
 * network classified the other way later blocks the core again.
 *
 * Reading needs no rights. Fixing does: one administrator prompt runs a
 * script that deletes every inbound rule naming this executable, the prompt's
 * block rules included, since a block wins over an allow, and adds one rule
 * named Boite that allows its TCP connections on the Private profile only: a
 * public network (a café, a station) stays closed. Both scripts are passed
 * encoded, so a path holding a quote cannot break out of them.
