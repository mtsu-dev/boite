/**
 * `boite`, the CLI an agent runs inside a thread. It is `boite-core cli`
 * behind a shim on the PATH; a process the thread launched finds the core and
 * its own token in the environment the core put there (`AGENT_ENV`) and says
 * hello as the `agent` of that thread. Every answer is a few `key: value`
 * lines or one row per item, which is what a model reads back at the lowest
 * cost; `--json` gives the raw result to a script.
 *
 * Without that environment, `--thread <id>` drives any thread with the owner
 * token read out of `core.json`, the way `boite-core pair` finds its core.
