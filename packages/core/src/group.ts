/*
 * A group: the machines of one person that trust each other.
 *
 * Until groups, three things were set up one pair at a time: a pairing link per
 * client and per core, the browser origins of every other core, and the agent
 * coordination link between two cores. A group is one roster every member
 * holds, and those three follow from it. A client of one member asks it for a
 * ticket to another, the other checks the ticket against the roster and hands
 * the client a session key of its own; origins and coordination peers are read
 * off the same roster.
 *
 * Membership is symmetric and total: any member may invite, remove and vouch.
 * It suits the machines of one owner and nothing less trusted, which keeps the
 * manual pairing link for everything else. A removal is known to each member
 * when it hears of it: until then that member still treats the removed machine
 * as one of the group, with everything that grants. Once a member has heard, a
 * removed machine comes back only through a new invitation (docs/groups.md).
 *
 * What members say to each other is signed and sealed to the recipient
 * (`group/seal.ts`), whatever network carries it. What a client says to a core
 * is not: that link is as private as its transport, Tailscale, HTTPS, or a
 * LAN the owner chose to listen on, the same as a `ws://` pairing.
