/*
 * The roster of a group: the machines and the devices they vouch for.
 *
 * Every member holds the whole roster and they exchange it whole. What makes
 * a machine a member is an admission: the word of a machine that was already
 * one, signed, for one epoch. A removal ends that epoch for good, whatever
 * revision anybody shows afterwards, and only a new admission, signed by a
 * machine the receiver itself counts as a member, opens the next. So a removed
 * machine cannot write itself back in, directly or through a member that has
 * not heard of its removal: it would need a member's signature.
 *
 * Inside an epoch an entry carries a revision and the higher one wins: that is
 * a machine republishing its name and addresses. A device's removal is final
 * too. Removed entries stay as tombstones and are never dropped: one that went
 * missing would let a stale copy bring the entry back. The roster therefore
 * only grows, and a group stops taking new entries at a bound instead.
