/*
 * Where the other members of a group reach this core.
 *
 * Tailscale is the expected network: every machine of a tailnet has a stable
 * address in 100.64.0.0/10 and, with MagicDNS, a name that follows it. Both
 * are read without the Tailscale CLI, which is not on every PATH and needs no
 * process here: the address is on Tailscale's own network interface, and the
 * name is the PTR record Tailscale's resolver at 100.100.100.100 answers for
 * it, which that interface routes to the local daemon. The question goes out
 * as one datagram (`magic-dns.ts`): the system resolver answers a machine's
 * own address with its bare host name. A machine with no tailnet falls back
 * to its LAN address, as a pairing link does.
 *
 * The name is for other cores, whose requests are sealed to this machine's
 * key: a name that resolved elsewhere would reach a machine that reads
 * nothing. Clients, whose link is not sealed, are given a name over plain
 * HTTP only when it is a MagicDNS name (`ticketAddresses`, `ownAddress`,
 * `usableAddresses` in the UI).
