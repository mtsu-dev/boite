/*
 * A client carried to a member of its group by another member.
 *
 * A phone opens its page on one machine and reaches the others directly when
 * it can: over HTTPS from a secure page, or at an address written as numbers.
 * A member that gives neither, a desktop on the tailnet with no certificate
 * for instance, is out of a secure page's reach, and one that sleeps behind
 * another network is out of anybody's. The machine that served the page can
 * still reach it, so it carries the client there.
 *
 * `/group/relay/<core id>/rpc` is the other member's socket, piped: the
 * client's first frame is its `hello` for that member, with `relay` holding
 * its key for this one. This member checks that key, takes it out, opens a
 * socket on the other member and passes the rest on. From then on every frame
 * goes through unread. The member at the end authenticates the hello as it
 * would any other: a ticket, or the key a ticket became.
 *
 * `/group/relay/<core id>/file/<ticket>` and `/view/<ticket>` are fetched
 * from the other member and streamed back. Their tickets are what opens them,
 * as at the member's own address.
 *
 * What this machine sees: everything the client says to the other member and
 * hears back, its key for that member included. A member of a group already
 * has full control of every other (docs/groups.md), so this gives it nothing
 * it did not have. The hop between the two members carries client traffic,
 * so it is held to the client's rule: the other member's HTTPS address when
 * it has one, otherwise one written as numbers, never a name over plain HTTP.
