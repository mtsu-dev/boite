/*
 * How a client gets into the machines of a group.
 *
 * A device, a phone or a browser, holds one key the roster lists
 * (`device-keys.ts`): it is admitted once, with a grant, and says
 * hello on any member with a signature made for that member. The desktop app
 * of a member, and a client paired before device keys, gets a ticket from a
 * member it is connected to instead, exchanged on another member for a key
 * of that member's own. docs/internals/groups.md describes both.
