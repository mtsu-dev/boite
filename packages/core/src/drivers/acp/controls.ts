/**
 * The thread's permission mode as candidate `session/set_mode` ids, best first.
 * ACP standardises the call and the shape of `availableModes`, never the ids
 * inside it: every agent names its own modes. So each Boite mode carries the
 * spellings agents are known to use and the first one an agent lists wins.
 * `matchMode` compares without case, `_` or `-`, so the two spellings of a name
 * are one key; both are written out anyway, because the list is also what tells
 * a reader which agent uses which.
 *
 * - `default`, `auto_edit` and `yolo` are Antigravity's three session modes,
 *   which is what the mapping was written against; it has no plan mode.
 * - `acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`, `default` are Claude Code's
 *   permission modes, which its ACP bridge hands over as mode ids.
 * - `accept_edits`, `bypass_permissions`, `auto_edit`, `dont_ask` are the
 *   snake_case spelling of those same names.
 * - `build` is what OpenCode calls its plain mode, `normal` what several
 *   smaller agents call theirs. OpenCode lists `build` and `plan` as a config
 *   option of category `mode`, with no `availableModes` at all: the same
 *   candidates are matched against that option's values (`applyModeOption`).
 * - `auto` is the short name for a mode that approves everything.
 *
 * Every mode but `plan` ends on the agent's plain mode. An agent that only
 * knows `build` and `plan` has nothing closer to "edit freely", and a thread
 * that leaves `plan` for a mode the agent does not list must not stay in
 * `plan`: the plain mode is where the agent works, and whatever it still asks
 * arrives as a permission request the thread's mode answers.
